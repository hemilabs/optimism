      # Workaround to prevent slither-action from trying to install JS deps.
      # Without this step, it detects the `package.json``, and since there is no
      # lockfile it defaults `npm install` which fails due to the preinstall
      # script to enforce pnpm. https://github.com/crytic/slither-action/issues/44#issuecomment-1338183656
